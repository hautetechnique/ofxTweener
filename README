ofxTweener is the missing tween class for open frameworks. It's implementation is much like AS3's Tweener and TweenMax. It uses a single, static tweenclass that controls all tweens using references. That means that there's no need to update the individual vars. 

v1.0 06-08-2011

functions:
	- single static class One tween class to control them all
	- central update() function can be called from within the draw function for visual sync tweening
	- reference variables no need to update 
	- delays
	- central time scaling
	- stop/remove all or individual tweens
	- override or sequence mode
	- bezier tweening
	
ofxTweener works with OF 0.06 and 0.07. It has been tested on OSX 10.6~7 and Windows as well. The included example is a Xcode 4 OF 0.07 project.
